# Minishell

## Project Description

The Minishell project at École 42 is a program that simulates a shell (command-line interpreter). It should be capable of reading, parsing, and executing commands from the user.

## Project Objectives

The objectives of the project are:
- Create a program that simulates a shell.
- Handle errors and signals.
- Handle environment variables.
- Handle local variables.
- Handle simple redirections (< and >).
- Handle pipes (|).

## Usage

To use the minishell, simply compile it and run it:

## Implemented Features

The implemented features in this project are:
- Handling errors and signals.
- Handling environment variables.
- Handling local variables.
- Handling simple redirections (< and >).
- Handling advanced redirections (<< and >>).
- Handling pipes (|).
- Handling the "echo" command.
- Handling the "cd" command.
- Handling the "env" command.
- Handling the "export" command.
- Handling the "unset" command.
- Handling the "exit" command.
- Handling logical operators (&& and ||).

## Non-Implemented Features

The non-implemented features in this project are:
- Handling globbing with *.
- Handling the semi-colon command separator ;

## Conclusion

The Minishell project at École 42 was an excellent opportunity to put into practice the programming skills acquired throughout the curriculum. Handling errors and signals, environment variables, local variables, redirections, and pipes was a very enriching experience and helped to better understand how a shell works.
